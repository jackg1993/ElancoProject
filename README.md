# ElancoProject
<p>I'm currently working on a project for Elanco that allows a user to upload images of animals. This is then processed within a machine learning API and the results are displayed back to the user. We are at the stage where we are able to see breeds of animals along with other useful bits of information. This is mostly being built using Node.js and we are still currently working on this to add new features and we are rebuilding the fron-end using React.</p>
